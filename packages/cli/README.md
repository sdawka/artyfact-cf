# @artyfact/cli

`artyfact start|checkpoint|submit|status|compose`. Platform URL from `ARTYFACT_URL` (default http://localhost:5173).

The fork write token is read only from the `ARTYFACT_TOKEN` environment variable (there is no `--token` flag, since
argv is visible to other processes). It is handed to git through `GIT_CONFIG_*` environment variables for the
duration of one command, and is never written to `.artyfact.json`, `TASK_PACKET.md`, `AGENTS.md` or git config.
Set it again for each `start` and `submit`.

Every platform call carries the realization secret as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`. Start work returns it once,
inside the printed start line as `ARTYFACT_SECRET=…`. `start` reads it from `ARTYFACT_SECRET` and saves it in
`.artyfact.json` (mode 0600, git-excluded); later commands use the saved copy, and `ARTYFACT_SECRET` overrides it. It
is never taken from argv, never printed, and scrubbed from `TASK_PACKET.md` and `AGENTS.md`. A rejected realization's
secret stops working (403).

`TASK_PACKET.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `.artyfact.json` are listed in the clone's `.git/info/exclude`, so they are never
committed. If the repo already tracks `AGENTS.md`, the CLI keeps it tracked and maintains a block between
`<!-- artyfact:start -->` and `<!-- artyfact:end -->`. The remote must be an Artifacts host
(`<32-hex>.artifacts.cloudflare.net`); `ARTYFACT_ALLOW_REMOTE_HOST=<host>` opts one other host in for local dev.
`submit` pushes to the remote recorded in `.artyfact.json`, not to `origin`.
